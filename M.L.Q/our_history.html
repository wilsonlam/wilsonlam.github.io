          </strong>It all began my sophomore year in high school when my first  real engineering based competition was presented to me. My team and I were  required to build a robot that could relocate racquetballs to a higher  location. This success of a robot has taught me to be more interactive  and contribute more towards my team with a similar goal to win. It was then  that I began to understand that what field of technology  I pursue will determine whether or not I would be successful in life or  not. There is no  doubt in my mind, then, that I wish to pursue a career that will not only  require me to continuously learn, but also help the world recover from its  predicted path of destruction.</p>          </td>

          As a kid,  my dad, a building technician in L.A.  would let me oversee and engage on tasks that needs done. Jobs would include  car maintenance, home improvement, and solving common problems. In being able  to be exposed to all sorts of technology and scenerios, Iâ€™ve developed a  passion in figuring out how everything works. I am currently a high school  senior at Alhambra High    School, when I plan to explore the fields of Film  in college.<br />

          The  spark for my scientific knowledge begins during the ninth grade when I was in Mesa. Mesa have  shaped my understanding in science and given me a chance to integrate my  learning in physics to my mousetrap car and civil structure. I used the method  of torque in physics to help me calculate the best method or design I should  use. This is what I have learned in Mesa and is  one of the most cherished goals I have in my high school years. When I go to  college though, I want to continue this path of success to later on become a  scientist of engineer.<br />
